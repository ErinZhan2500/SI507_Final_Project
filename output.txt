Ravioli With Arugula, Pine Nuts, Raisins & Cream
Ingredient List:
	ravioli
	olive oil
	garlic
	pine nuts
	raisins
	arugula
	cream
	salt & pepper
Boil enough water to cook the ravioli in a medium-sized pot.  Once the
water has come to a boil, drop in the ravioli and cook it for the 4-6
minutes that is usually required for fresh ravioli.  Obviously, you
will need longer if using dried ravioli.  When there are about 4
minutes left in the ravioli cooking time, warm the olive oil to medium
heat in a large pan.  Add the pine nuts and saut them for about a
minute.  Add the garlic and saut for another minute.  Make sure that
it does not brown.  Then, add the raisins and arugula and stir for 20
to 30 seconds.  Once most of the arugula has begun to wilt, add the
cream and simmer for 1 minute.  Remove from heat.  Drain the ravioli,
place them in a bowl, and top with the arugula
